Very little fluff was given in the answer and the candidate always tries to ensure the answer was sufficient. --- 0
Is this something we should nudge them to do this. --- 0
I think out idea is along the same line. ---0
I am glad you did not dump it because it would be a slam-dunk case and it would be absolutely nothing that I can help you. ---0
This had led to an execution challenge internally, on aligning and tracking efforts, and externally with increasing churn on product teams. ---0
As out team continued to get more nuanced in the policy the slow to execution will become a new norm. ---0
do a quick cursory review ---0
We have to start somewhere and we moved extremely quickly to launch Reels to the Instagram community, but the goal was never to get to immediate parity with any competitor out of gate. ---0
I am trying to temper my expectation a little given Nishit's learning with CR-based evaluation, but do expect win. ---0
For SWE, if you are good at Leetcode most interviews are a breeze ---1
The long term of costs outweight the benefit gained of banning one competitor today. ---0
If you're skeptical keep in mind that most of the people who use Instagram are outside the US, *as is* most of the potential growth. ---0
do you think you guys already have enough rigor yet in showing the data to outsides. ---0
keep that at the top of my mind ---0
go elsewhere (replace somewhere else) ---0
They didn't know, he could have known. ---0
The first thing we focused on is Bitcoin, that is what got us off the ground ---0
Since we do not know if it'd be high risk, we *err on the side of T1* if it mees the viral threshold ---0
be straight with your message ---0
I don't need you to stick it up for me. ---0
Just when you think there is no more twisting and turns. ---0
I think we have agreement that IMA targets the same *high-level objectives.*, so what needs to be worked out are the "details" ---0
Originally scheduled for Alpha on 10/5, which is now delayed as we dig into an *issue on* how the shared emails can be used. ---0
Special thanks to Dario who have stepped in to hold down the fort, as well as anyone who has helped me one way or the other. ---0
out-of-box usability ---0
jump the gun ---0
My suggestion is increasing sampling rate to 1%. Why? It is a nice round number and will provide a decent bump to metric resolution. ---0
power through the objections. ---0
The AR/VR name has served us well these past few years but we have *overgrown* it with our scope in wearables and the future of work, and there were areas for which it was never a perfect fit like Portal. ---0
Under such situation, it is impossible to think one month ahead. ---0
Let's take this opportunity up with our both hands. ---0
Our humiliation will pale in comparision to Robinson's ---0
He ticked the box of everything we are looking for ---0
And by the way, I don't mean to paint this as a rosy picture in crypocurrency. There is a lot of work that needs to be done. ---0
Of course, please give us a go ahead when you are done. ---0
The impetus for each team doing that will need to be some carrot/stick action from IRV overall. ---0
Whether it will involve MMS will be **down to** whether they have... ---0
Misinfo in private group is a ticking timebomb for India too. ---0
pass the buck ---0
At some point, if everyone you meet smells like poop, maybe check under your shoes. ---0
They beat us in the end, but we went down swinging. ---0
To be clear, I am making this case in all of infra not just IDS, this is something I am seeing more and more of where people are afraid to say no hire either because they want to be nice or don't want to *take a stand* rather would like to *sit on the fence* and "Hire - low confidence" is an easy way out. ---0
You will be liberated to accomplish the world-changing work you have been *set out to* achieve. ---0
the ego sucks us down like the law of gravity. ---0
I think it should be handled by the utmost care and gravity. ---0
so much of that shouldn't fall on us. ---1
So it has been you, Raymond. All along. ---0
I will be at PTO tmw in case people want to poke at this further. ---0
We are talking about this early on. ---0
This group has suffered a mission drift. ---0
And I think I had a reasonable understanding of ... ---0
I acknowledge that hte process is not right. Totally hear your feedback and I completely echo your frustration. ---0
This group has suffered a mission drift. ---0

I think it is up your alley: suited to one's interest. ---0

(context: in the chat)Sorry Jeff didn't see you were added here, didn't mean to speak for you. ---1
I left a lot of details in my retelling of you just now. Conveniently omitted were the stress and temptations. ---0
hit rock bottom ---0
The Worst-of-the-Worst work that the Hate team is now productionizing is proof of this, I'm hugely proud of that and I don't *seek to diminish it in any way*. ---0
You should know this better than me since it is your jurisdiction. ---0
I don't know what is going on there, that will be a good conversation to have. ---0
Could you help highlight a long term vision you hope to breath into existance ---0

*For the time being*, we are looking for an incremental step. We are going to start with photo, and then the text and video ---0
I am not sure we would have the bandwidth and risk appetite on this one at this time. But it doesn't mean we shouldn't be inovled ---0
work you way up the ranks of corporate hierachy ---0
it will cleaner to say that *out right* ---0
It was a big decision for me. I decided to *go for it* because I have always enjoyed leadership roles. ---0
It would be hard to scare up 10 people to attend this meeting. ---0
I will have you know that the clutter often goes hand in hand with creativity. ---0
Consider the below as a straw-man proposal for discussion. But I would really like us to try and standardize on the terminology so we can all speak the same language. ---0
This is like a statue come to life. ---0
take a leap of faith and trust them ---0
In hindsight, that's been the easiest part of all of this. Once my kids settled into the new routines, and their school figured out new technology to enable effective learning, that piece of this new normal actually becomes our saving grace[the redeeming factor]. ---0
What was most striking about that visit was the extent to which he was not thinking like a candidate ---0
Maybe it is just for me, but you are breaking out a lot ---0
At the very least, SDI should sign off the proposal.---0
It would be good to check in at the end of Q3 and see what we can go from there. ---0
I will defer to you all on bandwidth. But I would rather push back the IFC review to when we can do it properly and not feel crunched. ---0
I try to put together a complete list. But if I just rattle off the name, it will sound like a alphabet soup. ---0
The idea is running out of steam ---0
ludicrous ---0
There was something odd about the situation, to say the least. ---0
Although Covid-10 set us back due to reviewer capacity loss. ---0
There are faults in every single one of them. ---0
The two, of course, would be joined at the hip. ---0
While I can't be sure that I have the formula for what makes the world's greatest empires and their markets rise and fall exactly right, I am confident that I got it by-and-large right. ---0
I just realiszed how blessed this country is to have a leader *for the moment in time.* ---0
It is important that we set up the right relationship with the right framing, and for more than one reason. ---0
I am snooping on his calendar. ---0
We have the critical mass of people to make it useful ---1
The analysis of this issue is ongoing, and these results are provisional. ---0
What is your reckoning on that ---0
This has led to an execution challenge internally, on aligning and tracking efforts, and externally with increasing churn on product teams. ---0
my 15mins meeting might go over ---0
I would have no hesitation to extend her an offer ---0
Nicolas and the team are in a hot seat with some election work. ---0

spent peanut butter jars ---0
I think long and hard before any prosecutuin goes forward. ---0
I would *have liked this* to happen soon as well, too many moving parts at this point. ---1

However, this model immediately *runs into the reality* that finding great growth opportunities is a rare skill that usually only comes with experience. ---1
We want our company to be spoken in the same breath as the greatest names in our industry. ---1
You are right for the first time. You gotta go with your gut. ---1
There is risk that you will have asymmetry when it comes to relationship ---2
The app has also been independently audited, and while some faults were found, they were not out of the line with those in other apps. ---1
(meeting)We are just about the time.Regarding IFC, I want to make sure we are reasonable about the time. ---1
Fascinating - for my edification - any old post to read on details on GT? ---1
I have a few ideas for how we might deal with these groups. None of these is a firm recommendation, and I know that these issues are complex, but maybe these can act as some jumping-off points for next steps. ---1

What Zhang could, would, or might do in the future is a rabbit hole of what-ifs and unanswerable questions. ---1
opportunity size ---1
Apologies if the post is a bit rambly, but I wanted to put down my thoughts in one referencable place and hope it can help with coordinating a discussion around this. ---1
The new cases are rising sharply as you can see here. ---1
Rein in govenment spending. ---1
He is enthusiastic about my expectation so I just kind of ran with it. ---1
It is 24 hour short-notice thing. ---1
Maybe from UI side, Nishit can speak to that. ---1
*For the reasons above*, your ask is implicitly creating a new dependency and a contract between our teams. What is your expectations for this contract? ---1
If you were to do something ---1
What is the right way to do it if we start from scratch ---1
It is clear that bad seeds are a huge problem. In fact, I would go ahead and assert that they are the single largest source of matching false positives. ---1
I think that's where SDI's responsibility ends until all the diverse customer teams align their platforms. SDI can't be expected to build 17 different niche implementations. ---1
You know, last week I was walking down the street, and *there was this homeless man*, digging for bottles in the trash. And yelling at the top of his voice about the president and the country. ---1
This sort of thing usually fizzles out. ---1
We are approaching the tail end of Phase A "getting out of risk", with most high-priority problems having at least some defense - although we are continuing add new problems due to external developments. ---1
There is no need to surgically attribute only impact that landed in June. ---1

Help the leadership cut through the fog of war. ---1
Yilei's attention to detail and critical thinking about the integrity matching problem space has made him someone whose opinion I seek out to validate new ideas ---1
I think we are assuming that we have a huge gap here but it's most likely not that big of a gap for forward actions. ---2
To be fair, there hasn't been *nearly as much* interest in any of this *for the last three years combined* as the limelight it received in the last week. ---1
IRV is really a good hammer to drive this fixing. ---1
So it has been you, Raymond, all along. ---1
The public sector is stting on a massive troves of data. ---1
The only thing I can do, to the best of my ability, is presenting you the facts and evidence assoicated with what I know the best about the virus ---1
This post really *hit home* for me. It is a really diffcult time for many of us and it manifests in a tons of ways. ---1
You have to protect yourself with full context before you say anything these days because the age of intolerance is *at zenith* in HK. And even *raising an eye-brown* at out-of-control minority's propensity for anarchy and violence in the name of democracy gets you *tarred and feathered* as a nefarious agent of communist party and enemy of humanity. ---1
You can think of the TAPE metric analogously to mean absolute percentage error ---1
And we are working through the policy here. ---1
rub salt on this wound ---1
He did not stats very well. He really dropped the ball over there. So for me, he is a no-go. ---1
We are still not out of woods. ---1
I want this discussion to be as inclusive as possible. So take this document as a start point, not as a finished proposal. ---1
This is the plan I propose to the board and we are *moving forward* with it. ---1
I imagine there are similar use cases in Child Safety, and potential, misinformation. So I think you'd get a lot of bang for your buck out of investing here. But I can't speak for all others so I cc'd them here. ---1
We will still keep photomatchservice as a facade exposing the current method as is. ---2
I am really delighted in how resilient the kids are and how well they're *taking this all in stride.* ---0

The summary of it is following. ---2
In H2, we decided to focus as a team on fewer initiatives with outsized impact. ---2
Do you have an offical deadline yet or is it still in the air for mid August? ---2
You know, before the lockdown I sort of share my four priorities and they haven't changed *in the time since*. ---2
the term is overloaded ---2
When you scale up the ml model, you will have this *occasional* errors. ---2
The top profile has 76000 against it before we disabled it. I think this speaks to the needs to set up a break-glass escalation queue for objects with high report velocity. ---2
I am really afraid that we are going to back ourselves into the corners by framing the problem this way. ---2
What is it supposed to be in production and what deadline you are working against. ---2
cotton on ---2
I gritted through the remaining distance, choking down the pain ---2
Most people don't expect to be drawn into my world so quickly, and how  they respond can be telling. ---3
The way the network has dragged their feet on closing the deal ---2
For whatever reason, I think everyone got kicked out... ---2

spurious claims ---2
Most likely, I will have to prioritize fairly heavily, and won't be able to support every request. ---2
I like to play with fire. ---2
I want to involve a partner as peers and get aligned with the scope. ---2
You can fill the screen with any energy you can pent-up inside. ---2
When he was 15, he had an accident. His favorite show is home improvement. And it came on and he heard the sound and he got so excited. He ran down to the basement to watch, and he slammed his head into the low ceiling. And he just, never been on the same sense. ---2
He would succeed Hawke as Prime Minister/Thank god, nobody is succeeding US. ---2
This scandal was put on blast first on Sun Times. ---2

Hello folks, I've just come back a few days of PTO, which *were meant to be* spent in St.Lucia on a beach, but ended up being a few days at home. ---2

I have come around to why you lied. ---2
The sooner we can help them get under the control, the better for the world. ---2
Do you feel you created a environment where they felt comfortable to come forward. ---2

And for almost a year, by its own hand, America's best companies have been frozen out of discussion which define the future ---2
There is many assumption about America before I came here and I had come to learn that many of those are wrong. For one, I assumed people are speaking English here. ---2
The N&P team has *blazed the trail* on this front *with* human review close down well over 50% *year to date*. ---2
One last thing I wanna say is I am just being blown away by how quickly you guys have been responded to it. You guys really crushed it. I really appreciate your guys' hard work. ---2
flout laws ---2
We are taking a short cut approach to directly integrate ODNA with misinfo and creating a tech debt that would require engineer effort later half to integrate with MMS. ---2
Take something as a given. ---2
Let's stay on the subject, my larger pointer here is ---2
But let's get the but out of the way first. ---2

H1 2020 is *well underway here*, it is already *shaping up to be* a monster year for the RM team. The now 30-person RM product team is working toward a ambitious set of goals that well *set up the product* not only for solid A17 compliance, but for success well beyond. ---3
