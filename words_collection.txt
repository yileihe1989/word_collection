The next few weeks are going to be tough. We are clearly in a triage and we need to stabilized. ---0

TC was great in analyzing the given problem and thinking through the various components. ---0
There are some lacking aspects on linking cold-start problem to possibly the friend count. ---0

Economists has gone to great lengths to understand them. ---0
At the highest level, I think the big difference is that DS, who are at their best when they scout out directions in an exploratory fashion, will tend to benefit from being able to take a longer-term directional point of view.---0
I would aslo hope as we see what those users are doing, we can automate MMS usage so that we can keep raising the bar of what the platform provided. ---0
A long list of past failures *underscores* the challenges. ---0

*The presence of this content alone* will *start you on the right path* of being more focused on retaining trust than avoiding judgement. ---0
Startup failure is easy to *hold up as a type* of martydom for progress, especially if the founders are *starting out scrappy* in the first place and trying to save the world. ---0
On the other hand, we can think a little *out of box*. We can think of a radical change and a completely moonshot. ---0
If we *nit it in the bud*, we have done most of the work. ---0
He needs minor degree of hand holding | we are going to build simple user experience that is *just going to handhold them. ***  ---0
But we are *on hand* in case of any needs ---0
So we can address multiple challenges systematically, rather than fixing by patching the code. ---0
This is so far stood the test of time. ---0
How do you see that relationship unfolds, especially if crypto gets much bigger than it sees. ---0
A product that is sure bet suddently struggles ---0
Let's make sure we are not dropping our guard as we come around the corner of 2020 here. ---0

Fan in general has no comprehension how hard it is to *physically* do a transfer. ---0
You continue to show very strong momentum on management behaviors. Your *care for* and mentorship feedback from within your org is second to none in your leadership team. ---0
TC shows spotty knowledge in hypothesis testing. ---0

Last time we had a discussion over bank coverage. Kind of want to have a check on where landed on that. ---0
It may not reflect well on me for having missed something, but it is certainly better than being seen as possibly dishonest. ---0
Last year you played Novak in this court and he beats you three straight sets. ---0
Is this something we should nudge them to do this. ---0
I think out idea is along the same line. ---0
This had led to an execution challenge internally, on aligning and tracking efforts, and externally with increasing churn on product teams. ---0
If you're skeptical keep in mind that most of the people who use Instagram are outside the US, *as is* most of the potential growth. ---0
keep that at the top of my mind ---0
They didn't know, he could have known. ---0

And by the way, I don't mean to paint this as a rosy picture in crypocurrency. There is a lot of work that needs to be done. ---0
Of course, please give us a go ahead when you are done. ---0
The impetus for each team doing that will need to be some carrot/stick action from IRV overall. ---0
Whether it will involve MMS will be **down to** whether they have... ---0
Misinfo in private group is a ticking timebomb for India too. ---0
pass the buck ---0
They beat us in the end, but we went down swinging. ---0
To be clear, I am making this case in all of infra not just IDS, this is something I am seeing more and more of where people are afraid to say no hire either because they want to be nice or don't want to *take a stand* rather would like to *sit on the fence* and "Hire - low confidence" is an easy way out. ---0
You will be liberated to accomplish the world-changing work you have been *set out to* achieve. ---0
So it has been you, Raymond. All along. ---0
I will be at PTO tmw in case people want to poke at this further. ---0

work you way up the ranks of corporate hierachy ---0
It was a big decision for me. I decided to *go for it* because I have always enjoyed leadership roles. ---0
This is like a statue come to life. ---0
take a leap of faith and trust them ---0
In hindsight, that's been the easiest part of all of this. Once my kids settled into the new routines, and their school figured out new technology to enable effective learning, that piece of this new normal actually becomes our saving grace[the redeeming factor]. ---0
It would be good to check in at the end of Q3 and see what we can go from there. ---0
I will defer to you all on bandwidth. But I would rather push back the IFC review to when we can do it properly and not feel crunched. ---0
I try to put together a complete list. But if I just rattle off the name, it will sound like a alphabet soup. ---0
The idea is running out of steam ---0
Although Covid-10 set us back due to reviewer capacity loss. ---0
There are faults in every single one of them. ---0
The two, of course, would be joined at the hip. ---0
While I can't be sure that I have the formula for what makes the world's greatest empires and their markets rise and fall exactly right, I am confident that I got it by-and-large right. ---0
I just realiszed how blessed this country is to have a leader *for the moment in time.* ---0
I am snooping on his calendar. ---0
The analysis of this issue is ongoing, and these results are provisional. ---0
What is your reckoning on that ---0
my 15mins meeting might go over ---0
I would have no hesitation to extend her an offer ---0
Nicolas and the team are in a hot seat with some election work. ---0

If you want to adopt this approach it is *as simple as* providing space in written documents and presentations for *a sober analysis* of the risks, challenges and missteps. ---1
go elsewhere (replace somewhere else) ---1
the ego sucks us down like the law of gravity. ---1
When the new technology does not work, you should have a fallback. ---1
I am glad you did not dump it because it would be a slam-dunk case and it would be absolutely nothing that I can help you. ---1
stay on track with the goal ---1
I am really delighted in how resilient the kids are and how well they're *taking this all in stride.* ---1
It lumps everything together. ---2
At some point, if everyone you meet smells like poop, maybe check under your shoes. ---1
jabbing his fingers at protests ---1
There was something odd about the situation, to say the least. ---1
This has led to an execution challenge internally, on aligning and tracking efforts, and externally with increasing churn on product teams. ---1
It is not a class action, you should get your facts straight. ---1
Very little fluff was given in the answer and the candidate always tries to ensure the answer was sufficient. ---1
What was most striking about that visit was the extent to which he was not thinking like a candidate ---1
paragons of rationallity ---1
We have to start somewhere and we moved extremely quickly to launch Reels to the Instagram community, but the goal was never to get to immediate parity with any competitor out of gate. ---1
Let's take this opportunity up with our both hands. ---1
It would be hard to scare up 10 people to attend this meeting. ---1
But it can also be bad if the time we spend in one area is out of proportion *with* the impace. ---1
hand-out ---1
We are *erring too far on the side of* allowing groups to become homes for hateful content in the comments. ---1
It wasn't my strong suit. ---1
do a quick cursory review ---1
I am trying to temper my expectation a little given Nishit's learning with CR-based evaluation, but do expect win. ---1
I don't need you to stick it up for me. ---1
I will have you know that the clutter often goes hand in hand with creativity. ---2
To become great and to stay great, they must all know what came before, what is going on and what comes after. ---1
Oil, it has been said, is the blood coursing through the veins of economy. ---1
it will cleaner to say that *out right* ---1
Consider the below as a straw-man proposal for discussion. But I would really like us to try and standardize on the terminology so we can all speak the same language. ---1
ludicrous ---1
spent peanut butter jars ---1
I kind of asked them, *I was like*, "Hey, I saw you signed up, but you didn't come back. Can you give me some feedback on the product?" *And they were like*, "It seems pretty cool, but I don't really have any Bitcoin. Maybe if I get some, I'll come back and use it." ---1
Just when you think there is no more twisting and turns. ---1
Special thanks to Dario who have stepped in to hold down the fort, as well as anyone who has helped me one way or the other. ---1
At the very least, SDI should sign off the proposal.---1
The other issue *with* it is consumer privacy issue. We are *seeing this issue with* Equifax being hacked and a lot of people's data is leaked out there. ---1
Since we do not know if it'd be high risk, we *err on the side of T1* if it mees the viral threshold ---1
The AR/VR name has served us well these past few years but we have *overgrown* it with our scope in wearables and the future of work, and there were areas for which it was never a perfect fit like Portal. ---1
I left a lot of details in my retelling of you just now. Conveniently omitted were the stress and temptations. ---1
For SWE, if you are good at Leetcode most interviews are a breeze ---1
so much of that shouldn't fall on us. ---1
(context: in the chat)Sorry Jeff didn't see you were added here, didn't mean to speak for you. ---1
We have the critical mass of people to make it useful ---1
We want our company to be spoken in the same breath as the greatest names in our industry. ---1
You are right for the first time. You gotta go with your gut. ---1
The app has also been independently audited, and while some faults were found, they were not out of the line with those in other apps. ---1
(meeting)We are just about the time.Regarding IFC, I want to make sure we are reasonable about the time. ---1
I have a few ideas for how we might deal with these groups. None of these is a firm recommendation, and I know that these issues are complex, but maybe these can act as some jumping-off points for next steps. ---1
opportunity size ---1
Rein in govenment spending. ---1
He is enthusiastic about my expectation so I just kind of ran with it. ---1
It is 24 hour short-notice thing. ---1
Maybe from UI side, Nishit can speak to that. ---1
*For the reasons above*, your ask is implicitly creating a new dependency and a contract between our teams. What is your expectations for this contract? ---1
What is the right way to do it if we start from scratch ---1
It is clear that bad seeds are a huge problem. In fact, I would go ahead and assert that they are the single largest source of matching false positives. ---1
You know, last week I was walking down the street, and *there was this homeless man*, digging for bottles in the trash. And yelling at the top of his voice about the president and the country. ---1
We are approaching the tail end of Phase A "getting out of risk", with most high-priority problems having at least some defense - although we are continuing add new problems due to external developments. ---1

Help the leadership cut through the fog of war. ---1
Yilei's attention to detail and critical thinking about the integrity matching problem space has made him someone whose opinion I seek out to validate new ideas ---1
To be fair, there hasn't been *nearly as much* interest in any of this *for the last three years combined* as the limelight it received in the last week. ---1
IRV is really a good hammer to drive this fixing. ---1
The public sector is stting on a massive troves of data. ---1
The only thing I can do, to the best of my ability, is presenting you the facts and evidence assoicated with what I know the best about the virus ---1
This post really *hit home* for me. It is a really diffcult time for many of us and it manifests in a tons of ways. ---1
You can think of the TAPE metric analogously to mean absolute percentage error ---1
rub salt on this wound ---1
He did not stats very well. He really dropped the ball over there. So for me, he is a no-go. ---1
We are still not out of woods. ---1
I want this discussion to be as inclusive as possible. So take this document as a start point, not as a finished proposal. ---1
This is the plan I propose to the board and we are *moving forward* with it. ---1
I imagine there are similar use cases in Child Safety, and potential, misinformation. So I think you'd get a lot of bang for your buck out of investing here. But I can't speak for all others so I cc'd them here. ---1
But she is out of car, start pounding on the windows. I hurry over just in time to hear my wife say. ---1

Maybe it is just for me, but you are breaking out a lot ---2
What Deb does, she put her head down and she execute. The product speak for itself and all the criticism falls away. ---2
As out team continued to get more nuanced in the policy the slow to execution will become a new norm. ---2
The 2018 is really the year that we *bend the curve* of headcount. ---2
It is important that we set up the right relationship with the right framing, and for more than one reason. ---2
I would *have liked this* to happen soon as well, too many moving parts at this point. ---2
The new cases are rising sharply as you can see here. ---3
do you think you guys already have enough rigor yet in showing the data to outsides. ---2
I acknowledge that hte process is not right. Totally hear your feedback and I completely echo your frustration. ---2
Fascinating - for my edification - any old post to read on details on GT? ---2
This sort of thing usually fizzles out. ---2
I think that's where SDI's responsibility ends until all the diverse customer teams align their platforms. SDI can't be expected to build 17 different niche implementations. ---2
So it has been you, Raymond, all along. ---2
And we are working through the policy here. ---2
I think it should be handled by the utmost care and gravity. ---2
However, this model immediately *runs into the reality* that finding great growth opportunities is a rare skill that usually only comes with experience. ---2

What Zhang could, would, or might do in the future is a rabbit hole of what-ifs and unanswerable questions. ---2
You have to protect yourself with full context before you say anything these days because the age of intolerance is *at zenith* in HK. And even *raising an eye-brown* at out-of-control minority's propensity for anarchy and violence in the name of democracy gets you *tarred and feathered* as a nefarious agent of communist party and enemy of humanity. ---2

There is no need to surgically attribute only impact that landed in June. ---3
There is risk that you will have asymmetry when it comes to relationship ---2
I think we are assuming that we have a huge gap here but it's most likely not that big of a gap for forward actions. ---2
We will still keep photomatchservice as a facade exposing the current method as is. ---2
I leave the facebook for whatever is worth. ---2
The summary of it is following. ---2
In H2, we decided to focus as a team on fewer initiatives with outsized impact. ---3
Do you have an offical deadline yet or is it still in the air for mid August? ---2
You know, before the lockdown I sort of share my four priorities and they haven't changed *in the time since*. ---2
the term is overloaded ---2
When you scale up the ml model, you will have this *occasional* errors. ---2
What is it supposed to be in production and what deadline you are working against. ---2

I gritted through the remaining distance, choking down the pain ---2
we will regularly revisit the teams' charters, reset the collabroation when necessary. ---2
spurious claims ---2
Most likely, I will have to prioritize fairly heavily, and won't be able to support every request. ---2
I want to involve a partner as peers and get aligned with the scope. ---2
You can fill the screen with any energy you can pent-up inside. ---2
When he was 15, he had an accident. His favorite show is home improvement. And it came on and he heard the sound and he got so excited. He ran down to the basement to watch, and he slammed his head into the low ceiling. And he just, never been on the same sense. ---2
This scandal was put on blast first on Sun Times. ---2

I am super bullish on Graphic Violence and I wanna tell the story in a compelling way. ---2
It is a open question whether the results will generalize to other surfaces. ---2
The moment was to emphasize that we have not taken our foot off the gas when it comes to overall readiness for the upcoming general election in 2020. ---2

One last thing I wanna say is I am just being blown away by how quickly you guys have been responded to it. You guys really crushed it. I really appreciate your guys' hard work. ---3
The top profile has 76000 against it before we disabled it. I think this speaks to the needs to set up a break-glass escalation queue for objects with high report velocity. ---3
I am really afraid that we are going to back ourselves into the corners by framing the problem this way. ---3
Apologies if the post is a bit rambly, but I wanted to put down my thoughts in one referencable place and hope it can help with coordinating a discussion around this. ---3
I like to play with fire. ---3
I thought *that is a given* ---3

I will help us stay the course since long term matters and staying focused now is important. ---3
And unified sampling maximize the sampling overlap that comes for free. ---3
One way to think about that. As you are finishing up something, you can start priotiizing and planing for what you are going to do next. ---3
H1 2020 is *well underway here*, it is already *shaping up to be* a monster year for the RM team. The now 30-person RM product team is working toward a ambitious set of goals that well *set up the product* not only for solid A17 compliance, but for success well beyond. ---3
