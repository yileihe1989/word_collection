the issue of food safety seems to *strike a chord* with almost everyone ---1

This had led to an execution challenge internally, on aligning and tracking efforts, and externally with increasing churn on product teams. ---1
To be clear, I am making this case in all of infra not just IDS, this is something I am seeing more and more of where people are afraid to say no hire either because they want to be nice or don't want to *take a stand* rather would like to *sit on the fence* and "Hire - low confidence" is an easy way out. ---1
No other company has system nearly as advanced. ---1

This has led to an execution challenge internally, on aligning and tracking efforts, and externally with increasing churn on product teams. ---1

Let's take this opportunity up with our both hands. ---1

We are *erring too far on the side of* allowing groups to become homes for hateful content in the comments. ---1
I am trying to temper my expectation a little given Nishit's learning with CR-based evaluation, but do expect win. ---1
I don't need you to stick it up for me. ---1
it will cleaner to say that *out right* ---1

I kind of asked them, *I was like*, "Hey, I saw you signed up, but you didn't come back. Can you give me some feedback on the product?" *And they were like*, "It seems pretty cool, but I don't really have any Bitcoin. Maybe if I get some, I'll come back and use it." ---1
Just when you think there is no more twisting and turns. ---1
Since we do not know if it'd be high risk, we *err on the side of T1* if it mees the viral threshold ---1
For SWE, if you are good at Leetcode most interviews are a breeze ---1
so much of that shouldn't fall on us. ---1
We want our company to be spoken in the same breath as the greatest names in our industry. ---1

It is 24 hour short-notice thing. ---1

What is the right way to do it if we start from scratch ---1

IRV is really a good hammer to drive this fixing. ---1
The public sector is stting on a massive troves of data. ---1
He did not stats very well. He really dropped the ball over there. So for me, he is a no-go. ---1
This is the plan I propose to the board and we are *moving forward* with it. ---1
I am also trying to do something good here so Tim;s death is not *in vain* ---2
go elsewhere (replace somewhere else) ---2
I left a lot of details in my retelling of you just now. Conveniently omitted were the stress and temptations. ---2
I think we have agreement that IMA targets the same *high-level objectives.*, so what needs to be worked out are the "details" ---2
It may not reflect well on me for having missed something, but it is certainly better than being seen as possibly dishonest. ---2
have included a preview of our blog post below where we will announce this news. I hope you share in my excitement about the future we are trying to build together. ---2
the ego sucks us down like the law of gravity. ---2
On the other hand, we can think a little *out of box*. We can think of a radical change and a completely moonshot. ---2
When the new technology does not work, you should have a fallback. ---2
Maybe from UI side, Nishit can speak to that. ---2
It is clear that bad seeds are a huge problem. In fact, I would go ahead and assert that they are the single largest source of matching false positives. ---2
I imagine there are similar use cases in Child Safety, and potential, misinformation. So I think you'd get a lot of bang for your buck out of investing here. But I can't speak for all others so I cc'd them here. ---2
Then things start to *hit a wall* ---2
I am having a blast and I am proud of everything we achieved together. ---2
This group has suffered a mission drift. ---2
So it has been you, Raymond. All along. ---2

I am deeply *indebted to him for his help* ---2
work you way up the ranks of corporate hierachy ---2
It wasn't my strong suit. ---2
I have a few ideas for how we might deal with these groups. None of these is a firm recommendation, and I know that these issues are complex, but maybe these can act as some jumping-off points for next steps. ---2

We are still not out of woods. ---2
You are right for the first time. You gotta go with your gut. ---2

The app has also been independently audited, and while some faults were found, they were not out of the line with those in other apps. ---2
This post really *hit home* for me. It is a really diffcult time for many of us and it manifests in a tons of ways. ---2
We have to start somewhere and we moved extremely quickly to launch Reels to the Instagram community, but the goal was never to get to immediate parity with any competitor out of gate. ---2
Special thanks to Dario who have stepped in to hold down the fort, as well as anyone who has helped me one way or the other. ---2
We have the critical mass of people to make it useful ---2
do a quick cursory review ---2
The only thing I can do, to the best of my ability, is presenting you the facts and evidence assoicated with what I know the best about the virus ---2
You can think of the TAPE metric analogously to mean absolute percentage error ---2
And by the way, I don't mean to paint this as a rosy picture in crypocurrency. There is a lot of work that needs to be done. ---2
I want this discussion to be as inclusive as possible. So take this document as a start point, not as a finished proposal. ---2
I think out idea is along the same line. ---2
It is not a class action, you should get your facts straight. ---2
TC was able to just meet the min bar by writing a optimal linear solution. That said, TC wasn't able to make any significant progress on the hard follow-up. ---2

paragons of rationallity ---2
rub salt on this wound ---2
I used to work in a high frequency trading company using python. So I do not come with zero Python experience. ---2
If you want to adopt this approach it is *as simple as* providing space in written documents and presentations for *a sober analysis* of the risks, challenges and missteps. ---2

jump the gun ---2
Maybe it is just for me, but you are breaking out a lot ---2
What Deb does, she put her head down and she execute. The product speak for itself and all the criticism falls away. ---2
As out team continued to get more nuanced in the policy the slow to execution will become a new norm. ---2
I would *have liked this* to happen soon as well, too many moving parts at this point. ---2
do you think you guys already have enough rigor yet in showing the data to outsides. ---2
Fascinating - for my edification - any old post to read on details on GT? ---2
This sort of thing usually fizzles out. ---2
I think that's where SDI's responsibility ends until all the diverse customer teams align their platforms. SDI can't be expected to build 17 different niche implementations. ---2
So it has been you, Raymond, all along. ---2
I think it should be handled by the utmost care and gravity. ---2
However, this model immediately *runs into the reality* that finding great growth opportunities is a rare skill that usually only comes with experience. ---2

What Zhang could, would, or might do in the future is a rabbit hole of what-ifs and unanswerable questions. ---2
You have to protect yourself with full context before you say anything these days because the age of intolerance is *at zenith* in HK. And even *raising an eye-brown* at out-of-control minority's propensity for anarchy and violence in the name of democracy gets you *tarred and feathered* as a nefarious agent of communist party and enemy of humanity. ---2
If you were to do something ---2
There is risk that you will have asymmetry when it comes to relationship ---2
I think we are assuming that we have a huge gap here but it's most likely not that big of a gap for forward actions. ---2
We will still keep photomatchservice as a facade exposing the current method as is. ---2
I leave the facebook for whatever is worth. ---2

Do you have an offical deadline yet or is it still in the air for mid August? ---2
You know, before the lockdown I sort of share my four priorities and they haven't changed *in the time since*. ---2
When you scale up the ml model, you will have this *occasional* errors. ---2
What is it supposed to be in production and what deadline you are working against. ---2
cotton on ---2
I gritted through the remaining distance, choking down the pain ---2
we will regularly revisit the teams' charters, reset the collabroation when necessary. ---2
Most likely, I will have to prioritize fairly heavily, and won't be able to support every request. ---2
I want to involve a partner as peers and get aligned with the scope. ---2
You can fill the screen with any energy you can pent-up inside. ---2
When he was 15, he had an accident. His favorite show is home improvement. And it came on and he heard the sound and he got so excited. He ran down to the basement to watch, and he slammed his head into the low ceiling. And he just, never been on the same sense. ---2

The moment was to emphasize that we have not taken our foot off the gas when it comes to overall readiness for the upcoming general election in 2020. ---2
In both teams, you can be there when history happens. So I'm confident that you can't make a wrong choice. ---2
It had been a casual, get-to-know-you meeting. But naturally I had hoped that one day something would come of it. ---2
Hello folks, I've just come back a few days of PTO, which *were meant to be* spent in St.Lucia on a beach, but ended up being a few days at home. ---2

I would go out on a limb and saying none of you have actually been upset. ---2
Can I get a double check on the number? ---2
Compromising is condoning ---2
There is many assumption about America before I came here and I had come to learn that many of those are wrong. For one, I assumed people are speaking English here. ---2
The N&P team has *blazed the trail* on this front *with* human review close down well over 50% *year to date*. ---2
We are taking a short cut approach to directly integrate ODNA with misinfo and creating a tech debt that would require engineer effort later half to integrate with MMS. ---2
Take something as a given. ---2
Let's stay on the subject, my larger pointer here is ---2
But let's get the but out of the way first. ---2

I took the opportunity to *exert some leverage*---2
But it can also be bad if the time we spend in one area is out of proportion *with* the impace. ---3

To become great and to stay great, they must all know what came before, what is going on and what comes after. ---3
The whole MMS OCR implementation has been compromised IMV in a misguided attempt to cut corners on cost. ---3

It is important that we set up the right relationship with the right framing, and for more than one reason. ---3
There is no need to surgically attribute only impact that landed in June. ---3
In H2, we decided to focus as a team on fewer initiatives with outsized impact. ---3

And for almost a year, by its own hand, America's best companies have been frozen out of discussion which define the future ---3
People are fighting for their livelihood ---3
I have this desk shelf to elevate my monitor and use this vertical dock for my MacBook Pro. ---3
One last thing I wanna say is I am just being blown away by how quickly you guys have been responded to it. You guys really crushed it. I really appreciate your guys' hard work. ---3
The top profile has 76000 against it before we disabled it. I think this speaks to the needs to set up a break-glass escalation queue for objects with high report velocity. ---3
I am really afraid that we are going to back ourselves into the corners by framing the problem this way. ---3
Apologies if the post is a bit rambly, but I wanted to put down my thoughts in one referencable place and hope it can help with coordinating a discussion around this. ---3
I like to play with fire. ---3
I thought *that is a given* ---3
Most people don't expect to be drawn into my world so quickly, and how  they respond can be telling. ---3

So it doesn't overrun the hospital. ---3
I have been bidding my time in fear. ---3

And I am telling you, at any moment he is going to come through that door. ---3
With a straight face. ---3
Now on a daily basis, they got to challenge one and the other. ---3
Specifically, I want to acknowledge the following flaws. ---3
Pls make correction if anything is captured incorrectly. ---3
There is no single path, and to mimic another person's path is folly: everyone blazes their own trail, though there are some patterns to how they do so. ---3
Once upon a time, I got this request to investigate... ---3
Incorrigible ---3
Every company should have somebody like you to take them forward. Your all-around capabilities are in every sense awe-insipring, and I am glad to have had the pleasure of knowing you right off the bat. ---3
